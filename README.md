Presenting easy-to-use data on Israel age composition and comparing it to other OECD countries


The goal of this project is to merge data about Israel's age composition by year and to enable comparisons between Israel and other OECD countries. 

Israel's population is unique among Developed countries in its very high and consistent birth rate. This leads to unusually young age distribution. Because age is amain factor in many contexts, this uniqueness of Israel makes it hard to compare to other developed countries in economic and sociologic factors.  
This project presents the extent of this problem and suggests a solution that is widely used in epidemiology and demography, but not enough in economy and sociology: age-standardized ratios.


Although data about age composition is easy to find from many sources, 
most of those contain data for every year separately, and only for age groups. Also, the most common age composition data in use is about the population at the end of the year, which is different and inferior to the demographic method of using yearly averages. Furthermore, mixing data for different years from different sources may lead to inconsistent time series and bug any statistical models based on it.
